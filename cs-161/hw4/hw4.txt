I can't figure out what's erroring. I tried my best. Sorry about my code :(
I do know about the map coloring problem, though. My guess is that graph1 is not
satisfiable with 3 colors but is with 4, and that would tell me that the minimum
number of colors needed to color in graph1 is 4. This would also be the case for
graph2 (or maybe graph2 requires fewer colors than 4), because it is known from
the four color theorem that no more than 4 colors are needed to color a map and
ensure that regions sharing a border do not share a color. In this case our
borders are edges and regions are nodes in the graph.
